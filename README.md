# Day-Planner

# Description 

In this project I create a Day Planner mostly for the 9-5 individual. It allows the user to plan each day productively and increase efficiency throughout their day.

 The header displays details of the Website name and a short sentence of its purpose. The header also contains the current date and time. Refreshing the page will update to the most recent 
 
 time. I use moment.js to get the updated date and time. 


  Below the header is the Planner. On the left displays the hour in a sequential form, in the middle is the input field for users to enter info at a specific time. The  input 
 
 blocks change color based on what time it is. With grey indicating the time has passed, red indicating the current hour and green indicating future time. The user can then click 
 
 the save button to save their info. When the page refreshes the user info will still be displayed in the input area it was typed in. 

# Tech Used
 HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript  - Used for front-end design and layout
