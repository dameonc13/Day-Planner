# Day-Planner


In this project I create a Day Planner mostly for a 9-5 individual but is also available for anybody to use.

# Header
 1:  The header displays details of the Website name and what is does, and also the current date and time. Refreshing the page will update to the most recent time. I use moment.js to get updated date and time.

 2: Below the header is the Planner. On the left displays the hour in a sequential form, in the middle is the input field for users to enter info at a specific time. The  input 
 
 blocks change color based on what time it is. With grey indicating the time has passed, red indicating the current hour and green indicating future time. The user can then click 
 
 the save button to save their info. When the page refreshes the user info will still be displayed in the input area it was typed in.
